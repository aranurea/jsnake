jsnake
A c++ implementation of snake using the ncures library

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To install 

This game uses ncurses library. 
It can be installed easily through most UNIX package manages, 
under the name ncurses or ncurses-dev

It is required to compile and play the game

$cd /path/to/jsnake/directory && make

this make the executable 'jsnake'

$ ./jsnake

The Makefile assumes you use the g++ compiler, if not, you may
need to do some manual configuration

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Source code options:

Many options are available by changing constants on the 
#define sections of the CPP file

1) STARTING_LENGTH defines how long the snake is to begin
   Beware that long Starting lengths can cause near instant death on
   spawn [ 10 is the default ]

2) LENGTH_PER_FOOD determines how much the snake should grow per food eaten 
   [ 1 is the default ]

3) 'COLS_PER_ROW' is a constant to try to make col/rows square
   A value of 1 makes the grid 1 row per 1 col, a value of 2 makes the grid
   2 rows per 2 cols. [ 2 is default ]

4) The game calculates frames once every 'TICK_LENGTH' ms
   'VERT_RATIO'  is a multiplier so that ticks when the
   snake is traveling up/down are 'VERT_RATIO' * TICK_LENGTH ms 
   and ticks when the snake is going Left and Right are 'TICK_LENGTH' ms
   This can offer additional tweaking beyond COLS_PER_ROW
   Keep in mind appropriate VERT_RATIO changes with COLS_PER_ROW

   TICK_LENGTH should be roughly from 40 - 100ms [ 105   is default ]
   VERT_RATIO should be roughly from 1 - 1.5     [ 1.00  is default ]

5) The colors of the Snake_Head, Body, and Food can be adjsuted on the lines
   init_pair

Future Work:

-A greeting menu with options for size, etc
-CLI options for a fixed size game, rather than scaling to terminal size
