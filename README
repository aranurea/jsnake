jsnake
A c++ implementation of snake using the ncures library

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Installation:

This game requires the ncurses library to compile 
It can be installed easily through most UNIX package managers, 
usually under the name ncurses or ncurses-dev

The Makefile assumes you use the g++ compiler and that
/usr/local/bin/ is a directory that is on the user's path
If not, further configuration may be required

$make && make install

$make            will compile the source code
$make install    will copy the binary to /usr/local/bin/ , which 
                 is part of the default path for most systems, allowing
                 you to run the binary from any directory 
                 ( may require sudo privleges )
$make clean      will remove the binaries from the local directory
$make uninstall  will remove the binaries from /usr/local/bin/  
                 ( may require sudo privleges )

Any changed to the source code require 
$make && make install

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Source code options:

Many options are available by changing constants on the 
#define sections of the jsnake.cpp file

Here are a few:

STARTING_LENGTH defines how long the snake is to begin
   Beware that long Starting lengths can cause near instant death on
   spawn [ 5 is the default ]

LENGTH_PER_FOOD determines how much the snake should grow per food eaten 
   [ 1 is the default ]

'COLS_PER_ROW' is a constant to try to make col/rows square
   A value of 1 makes the grid 1 row per 1 col, a value of 2 makes the grid
   2 rows per 2 cols. [ 2 is default ]

The game calculates frames once every 'TICK_LENGTH' ms
   'VERT_RATIO'  is a multiplier so that ticks when the
   snake is traveling up/down are 'VERT_RATIO' * TICK_LENGTH ms 
   and ticks when the snake is going Left and Right are 'TICK_LENGTH' ms
   This can offer additional tweaking beyond COLS_PER_ROW
   Keep in mind appropriate VERT_RATIO changes with COLS_PER_ROW

   TICK_LENGTH should be roughly from 40 - 100ms [ 105   is default ]
   VERT_RATIO should be roughly from 1 - 1.5     [ 1.00  is default ]

The colors of the Snake_Head, Body, and Food can be adjsuted on the lines
   starting init_pair

Future Work:

A greeting menu with options for size, etc

CLI options for a fixed size game, rather than scaling to terminal size

Some file to store custom keybindings, local highscores, etc
